% This file contains the APPENDIX

% If there is just one appendix, it must be called ``Appendix.'' For
% multiple appendices, use \chapter and a descriptive title,
% e.g., \chapter{Questionnaires}

\chapter*{Appendix}\label{appendix}

% \chapter* doesn't include it in the TOC, so we have to do that by
% hand.  If you have multiple chapters, use \chapter instead and
% remove the following line. 

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Appendix}

\pagestyle{plain} % removes header from Appendices

Some stuff that should go in an appendix
