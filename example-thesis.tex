% A Sample Thesis for the University of Salford
% =============================================

% Load the Salford Memoir Thesis class. By default (without options),
% this produces a 1-1/2 spaced thesis in 11 point font without running
% heads. Use package options singlespaced or doublespaced for single
% or double line spacing. The default font is tgheros, with options for times and palatino.
% Use package option headers if you want running heads. Use option fullpage if you want the text
% to occupy all allowable space (1 inch margins all around), or option
% manuscript if you want a page layout suitable for reviewing and
% proof reading. Option manuscript selects 12 pt type, doublespaced,
% approx. 25 lines per page, with approx. 72 characters per line. You
% may want to remove the option for the version you file in the Vault;
% it looks nicer and is a bit more compact. You can also use any
% options that the memoir class recognizes, such as 10pt for 10 point
% font, 11pt for 11 point font, 12pt for 12 point type,
% etc. Documentation of the memoir package can be found at
% https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en
